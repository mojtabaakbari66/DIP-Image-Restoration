# DIP-Image-Restoration
Wiener filter implementation in python with auto selection k based on best PSNR and MSSIM
This is a practice for Digital Image Processing (Gonzalez 4th ed. book) that automatically estimate best K value in wiener filter eq. There is two value for k.
1. K for best image MSSIM score 
2. K for best PSNR

As you can see, their values are not equal, but they are close to each other.
